Lessons
- Need to double escape newlines AND double quotes in on-chain metadata - \\n becomes \n when calling uri, then gets rendered as newline by OpenSea, and double quotes need to go into OpenSea escaped
- IPNS links (even HTTP versions) for image or animation_url do not appear on OpenSea, likely due to how long they take to resolve (timeouts)
- React.JS does not render on OpenSea's iframes (or possibly any iframes) due to baked-in call to window.localStorage. Need to modify build scripts.
- ALWAYS PUBLISH again on IPNS after an update
