  "description": "Legendary and coveted Replay Token for The Game of F473.\n\n\"F473\" (FATE) is an NFT experience that highlights cross-chain interoperability. Rather than a static NFT that remains in a wallet on one network, \"F473\" comes alive and accessible across both the Ethereum and the Polygon blockchain networks. \"F473\" serves as a foundation to spawn thousands of NFTs on Polygon that create a bespoke NFT collecting game that is unlocked only after the initial sale of \"F473\". The spawned assets allow for temporarily altering aesthetics of the core artwork, as well as altering the overall gameplay.\n\n\"F473\" utilizes hundreds of both digital and physical artistic assets, and numerous musical compositions. The core of the experience centers around a physical painting, which contains a hand-painted private key giving access to a cryptocurrency prize that will be revealed upon the auction's conclusion. As a signature @coin_artist crypto puzzle trail artwork, expect an interactive story woven together with mystery, intrigue, and surprise. The purchaser of the NFT will, of course, also own and determine the fate of the physical painting.\n\n\"F473\" can be played on IPFS: https://ipfs.coinartist.io/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5djyk5kj4d5dvad8ev3g2zfyu0ktrusqpwg3qdewd68772mdthhu/#/",
